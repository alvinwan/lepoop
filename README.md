# Le Poop
Undo your pip commands, inspired by [nvbn](http://github.com/nvbn/)'s [The Fuck](http://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) (no affiliation). Why use `Le Poop`? `pip install` can come with a slew of dependencies, and `pip uninstall` only removes the package you specified. `Le Poop` cleans up *all* the mess, in style.

To get started, simply install using pip.

```
pip install lepoop
```
